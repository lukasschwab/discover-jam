# [Discover Vimeo](http://lukasschwab.me/discover-jam/)

A project for Vimeo's 2018 intern hackathon: video recommendations via social graph, using exclusively public 'likes' data.

This repository contains the project's static site. The code herein is almost entirely authored by [gh/nfeldbaum](https://github.com/nfeldbaum) and [gh/florencelau](https://github.com/florencelau).

The recommendation server is not open source.
